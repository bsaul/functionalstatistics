title: About Me

I am a statistician by training, and I am particularly interested in developing and applying causal inference methods in ecology and conservation. In these domains, causal inference methods are often complicated by the fact that a unit's potential outcomes may depend on the exposure of other units. This is known as [causal inference with interference](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=causal+inference+with+interference&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart).

I maintain several [R](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html) packages, including [`geex`](https://github.com/bsaul/geex), a package which (hopefully) makes programming [estimating equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimating_equations) easier. I created `geex` from a pragmatic need to quickly iterate and debug variance estimation from a set of estimating equations. Without knowing its name at the time, the crucial abstraction I used in  `geex` is a common technique called [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying). The way I was able to align mathematical reasoning with computer programming led down the path of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (and once I discovered [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [category theory](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-category-theory-anyway)).

Currently, I lead the development of statistical and data pipeline software at Target RWE (formerly [NoviSci](https://www.novisci.com/)), where I use  [R](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and  [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
