## geex (R) 

Framework for estimating parameters and the empirical sandwich covariance matrix from a set of unbiased estimating equations (i.e. M-estimation) in R.

## inferference (R)

Provides methods for estimating causal effects in the presence of interference. Currently it implements the IPW estimators proposed by EJ Tchetgen Tchetgen and TJ Vanderweele in "On causal inference in the presence of interference" (Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 21(1) 55-75).

## interval-algebra (Haskell)

The `interval-algebra` package implements [Allen's interval algebra](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alspaugh/cls/shr/allen.html) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). The main module provides data types and related classes for the interval-based temporal logic described in [Allen (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1145/182.358434) and axiomatized in [Allen and Hayes (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8640.1989.tb00329.x). 

A good primer on Allen's algebra can be [found here](https://thomasalspaugh.org/pub/fnd/allen.html).
