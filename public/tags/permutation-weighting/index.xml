      <description>A few weeks ago, I demonstrated how permutation weighting (Arbour, Dimmery, and Sondhi 2020) can be used to estimate causal parameters under interference. Today, I show how to use the same idea to estimate parameters in a longitudinal marginal structural model (MSM) (Robins 1999; Robins, Hern√°n, and Brumback 2000). This post is mostly me proving to myself that it works when combining interference with longitudinal data in a MSM.</description>

      <description>One of my (many) side projects is estimating the effect of land conservation on outcomes such as deforestation. This is an exciting collaboration with Christophe Nolte at Boston University. I decided to use this project as an opportunity to refresh my knowledge on causal inference with interference (Hudgens and Halloran 2008) as well as take a closer look at several interesting articles that came across my desk. In this post, I try out the estimation framework in one of those articles and explore how it may be useful in the presence of interference.</description>
